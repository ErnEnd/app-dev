## **My favorite TV series**
If I were to make a list of my favorite series or movie, I would say [Breaking Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhesaQXLuRY) would be one of the top contenders. The series, from the first to the last, really hooked me in (which is funny considering the story centers on creating drugs) through its portrayal of an overqualified chemistry teacher and a drug addict partnering up to cook crystal methamphetamine. 

I have watched:
- [x] Breaking Bad Season 1 - 5
- [x] El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie
- [ ] Better Call Saul 

Though I've watched *El Camino*, I have yet to watch *Better Call Saul*, guess I know who to call next! 

I also plan to watch the following:
1. Mr. Robot
2. Wednesday
3. ...others that I can't seem to recall ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
